# How to Install WordPress with PHP 8.1 on VPSAI Servers

Setting up a WordPress site on VPSAI with PHP 8.1 can seem daunting, but with the right steps, you can have your site up and running in no time. This guide will walk you through the entire process, using terminal commands. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites
- A VPSAI account with SSH access
- Basic understanding of terminal commands

## Steps to Install WordPress

### 1. Update Package Lists
First, update your package lists to ensure you have the latest information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies.
```sh
sudo apt update
```

### 2. Install Apache Web Server
Next, install the Apache web server which will serve your WordPress site.
```sh
sudo apt install apache2
```

### 3. Install PHP 8.1 and Required Extensions
You may need to add a repository for PHP 8.1 depending on your VPSAI distribution. Here’s an example for Ubuntu/Debian using the Ondřej Surý repository:
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates
wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.sury.org.list https://packages.sury.org/php/apt
apt-get update
sudo apt install php8.1 php8.1-apache php8.1-mysql php8.1-xml php8.1-curl php8.1-gd php8.1-mbstring php8.1-json php8.1-zip
```
Adjust the commands based on your distribution's package manager and repository instructions.

### 4. Enable PHP Modules
Enable the necessary PHP modules.
```sh
sudo a2enmod php8.1
```

### 5. Restart Apache
Restart the Apache web server to apply the changes.
```sh
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### 6. Install MariaDB Database Server
Install MariaDB, the database server for your WordPress installation.
```sh
sudo apt install mariadb-server
```

### 7. Secure MariaDB
Run the `mysql_secure_installation` script to secure your MariaDB installation and set a strong root password.
```sh
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

### 8. Create a Database and User for WordPress
Log into the MariaDB shell and create a database and user for WordPress. Replace `<your_database_name>`, `<your_database_user>`, and `<your_strong_password>` with your desired details.
```sh
sudo mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE <your_database_name>;
CREATE USER '<your_database_user>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<your_strong_password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <your_database_name>.* TO '<your_database_user>'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;
```

### 9. Download WordPress
Download the latest version of WordPress.
```sh
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
```

### 10. Extract WordPress
Extract the downloaded WordPress archive.
```sh
tar -xzf latest.tar.gz
```

### 11. Move WordPress Files to Document Root
Move the extracted WordPress files to the Apache document root.
```sh
sudo mv wordpress /var/www/html
```

### 12. Create Custom PHP Configuration (Optional)
If you need to customize PHP settings, create a `php.ini` file in a directory like `/etc/php/8.1/cli` with your desired configuration.

### 13. Restart Apache
Restart the Apache web server once more to apply any new changes.
```sh
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### 14. Access WordPress Installation
Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your_server_IP_address>`. You will now be able to complete the WordPress installation process through the web interface.

## Optional: Installing phpMyAdmin
phpMyAdmin is a useful tool for managing your MariaDB databases through a web interface.

### Install phpMyAdmin Package
Install phpMyAdmin.
```sh
sudo apt install phpmyadmin
```

### Configure phpMyAdmin
During installation, select the Apache web server when prompted. Then, create a symbolic link.
```sh
sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/html/phpmyadmin
```

### Restart Apache
Restart Apache again to apply the phpMyAdmin configuration.
```sh
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Access phpMyAdmin
Now you can access phpMyAdmin through your web browser by navigating to `http://<your_server_IP_address>/phpmyadmin`. Use the root password you set for MariaDB during installation to log in.

## Additional Notes
- This guide provides a basic installation process. You might need to adjust commands or configurations based on your specific needs.
- Always ensure your server and software are up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities.

With these steps, you should have a working WordPress site running on your VPSAI server with PHP 8.1. Happy blogging!
